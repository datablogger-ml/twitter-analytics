## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to Scrape Twitter Data and Visualise the trend, topics and the sentiment, which is helpful in predicting the perception of the general public on some event/commodity.

### Methods Used
* Twitter Scraping
* Data Visualisation - WordCloud, Topic Modelling
* Sentiment Analysis
* Natural Language Processing

### Technologies
* Python
* Python-Twitter API
* sklearn
* Pandas, jupyter
* matplotlib
* nltk

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)


### Methods

#### 1. Twitter Scraping
#### 2. Data Visualisation

* <strong>WordCloud</strong> - It is a visual representation of text data. It displays a list of words, the importance of each beeing shown with different font sizes or colors. It is useful for quickly perceiving the most prominent terms.

* <strong>Topic Modelling</strong> - It is a method of Unsupervised Classification of documents, similar to clustering on numerical data, which finds natural groups of items (topics).


## Needs of this project
